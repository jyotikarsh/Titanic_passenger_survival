# Titanic_passenger_survival

This is Titanic Machine Learning Project with Support Vector Machine Classifier and Random Forests using scikit-learn.

In this project, I have used Python and scikit-learn to build SVC and random forest, and applied them to predict the survival rate of Titanic passengers.

Data preprocessing is one of the most prominent steps to make an effective prediction model in Machine Learning, and it is often a good practice to use data preprocessing 
pipelines. 

I have also built custom data transformers and chain where all these data pre-processing steps use scikit-learn pipelines.
